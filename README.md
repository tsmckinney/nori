## Source Code Dependencies
Add SDL3 and glad2 to the main directory (make sure you use the Core profile, otherwise it may not work!), naming them approporately.  Once you build the project, add SDL3.dll to the build.

## Controls
* **Mouse** - Look around
* **AWSD** - Movement
* **1 - 7** - Switch between different demo rooms
* **Alt + Enter** - Toggle Fullscreen
* **Esc** - Exit demo

## Thanks
- To CodeParade for starting this project
- To Srinivasa314 and CzechBlueBear for coming up with the idea of porting the project to SDL
- To several OpenGL tutorials for helping me port the debug drawing to modern OpenGL
